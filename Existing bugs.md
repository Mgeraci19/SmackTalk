## UI updates I want to make

1. Sudden death is displayed before the final round but it is not sudden death. It is just non-stop questions. So basically it is last man standing wins or something like that

2. Before the start of round 3 it should say 'Round Robin' and then in the description say that the fighting will continue until only 2 fighter remain.

3. Before the start of Round 1 writing Phase it should have an animation on the host screen. It should say 'Round 1' and then in the description say something quirky about surviving and then also say if you lose 3 straight you will get eliminated. 

4. The popup of corner men is confusing after round 1. I like that it says a bye but I want to see these people with the bye on the Round2 Writing Phase Page. They should have the captain larger with the corner men smaller and assocaited with them. It should be outlined and say round 2 bye on them as well

5. At the start of round 3 I dont see the corner men avatars at all. Resize the champs to be bigger and make the corner men smaller then them but visible. Under the champs avatar it should say supported by 'corner men name'

6. The current standing on the mobile screen has duplicated text and does not actually display the current standing
