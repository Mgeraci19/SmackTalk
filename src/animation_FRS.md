I want to add some more animations

## Feature Requests

1. On a 3 hit ko or special attack(same thing) I want there to be a special animation that plays. It should say 3 hit KO and the avatar should do some special attack animation. Lets talk about what this could be. Maybe a reaching out with a css arm or fireball and then the other avatar is KOes. Or like there should be one that the winning avatar casts a spell and the other one turns to particles and disapears. These should be slightly longer attack animations then usual and after them there should be a SPECIAL KO overlay similar to the KO screen

2. For the basic non-tie attacks I want to add some variety. One could be where the avatar spins at the loser and bounces off. Another could be where the avatar flys above and does a smash attack. A more complex one could be the avatar shoots its answer through the loser and the loser flinches when it hits. These should all just fill the place of the regular attack animation. It should be drag and drop and not affect the future state of the game. Architecture here should allow for adding new animations with ease

3. On the KO attacks that are not 3HKO there should be variety there too. I love the KO screen where the loser fly off. Lets make one where The losers avatar falls on its side after the winner hits it with a css punch. Also for CSS stuff I leave implemntation to you. It does not have to be CSS and more likely it would fit as a GSAP

The key with all of these is that the animations should be drag and drop and not affect the future state of the game. Architecture here should allow for adding new animations with ease. I dont want to break any existing animations when I implement these
